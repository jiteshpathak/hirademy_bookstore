# Frontend Application Development Assignment

## Objective:
I have successfully completed the frontend application development assignment. Utilizing React.js, I fulfilled the requirements of understanding and testing APIs, implementing UI pages, dynamically loading data from APIs, and recording a demo.

## Instructions:

### Technology Stack:
For this assignment, I chose React.js as the frontend framework to develop the application.

### Understanding and Testing APIs:
I thoroughly familiarized myself with the APIs provided at [softwium.com/fake-api/](softwium.com/fake-api/). Additionally, I rigorously tested the following APIs using Postman:
- GET /Books - [softwium.com/api/books](softwium.com/api/books)
- GET /Books/id - [softwium.com/api/books/23](softwium.com/api/books/23)

### Frontend Application Requirements:
I successfully implemented a mini frontend application meeting the specified UI pages:
- **Books Page**: I displayed links to all books, with each book name as a clickable link.
- **Book-Details Page**: Details of the selected book, including Title, ISBN, PageCount, and Authors, were displayed appropriately.
Moreover, I adhered to component-based architecture, incorporated routing functionality, and ensured proper error handling throughout the application.
